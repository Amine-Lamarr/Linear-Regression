<h1>Salary Prediction using Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge</h1>

This project is a simple yet powerful demonstration of predicting salaries based on years of experience using three regression models:
Linear Regression
Lasso Regression
Ridge Regression

<h2>It includes:</h2>

Data preprocessing
Data visualization
Feature scaling using StandardScaler
Training and comparing models
Evaluating models using MAE, MSE, and RÂ²
Making predictions (e.g., salary for 3 years of experience)

<h2>What You'll Learn</h2>

How to use sklearn models and compare their performance
The importance of feature scaling
Visualizing data and model predictions
Understanding basic regression metrics

<h2>Dataset</h2>

The dataset contains two columns:

YearsExperience

Salary

It's a basic dataset for beginners, perfect for regression practice.
